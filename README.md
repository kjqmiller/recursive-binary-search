# recursive-binary-search
Recursive binary search that takes an integer from the user and checks if it is in the list

## Why?
* I wanted to implement a binary search function myself as practice
* Good way to help me better understand recursion and how to write a recursive function

## Running the script
Uses Python 3 standard library, just run it in the interpreter of your choice. List of values can be modified if desired, just ensure it is SORTED by the time it is passed to the search function as binary search only works on sorted lists.
